# Online Retail Demand Forecasting

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end machine learning solution to forecast product demand for an online retail business. By leveraging historical sales data, the project aims to predict future demands, enabling better inventory management and improved customer satisfaction. The solution will be built and deployed using Google Cloud Platform services.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is an online retail dataset that includes historical sales data.

## Technical Overview
This project involves several key phases:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Machine Learning Model Development
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Deployment on Google Cloud Platform
6. Real-time Data Processing
7. Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance

## Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and model development
- Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
- Google Cloud Platform services including:
  - BigQuery for data warehousing
